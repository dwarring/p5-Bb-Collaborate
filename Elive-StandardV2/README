Perl bindings for the Elluminate Live Standard Bridge V2 API.

** DEVELOPER RELEASE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION **

Elluminate Live! (c) is software for virtual online classrooms. It is suitable
for meetings, demonstrations web conferences, seminars and IT deployment,
training and support.

Elive-StandardV2 is a set of Perl bindings and entity definitions for the
Elluminate Standard Bridge V2 SOAP services ('standardv2' adapter).

This is a newer alternative to the Command Toolkit, as supported by the
Elive::Entity classess ('default' adapter).

INSTALLATION
============
To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

SERVER CONFIGURATION
====================

Elluminate Live Manager
-----------------------
Please ensure that your the standard bridge (V2) is enabled. To do this,
login to http://your_server.com/elmcontrol with an appropriate administrator
account.

Edit/create the appropriate server instance and tick 'Elluminate Standard
Bridge V2 ...' in the 'Bridge Selection' section.

You will then be asked to enter the SDK username and password. 

TESTING

    There are additional live tests in t/1?-soap-*.t. By default, these
    either skipped or run offline.

    These may be run against a live server by setting up the environment
    variables, an running tests, as shown below:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        export ELIVE_TEST_URL=http://sdk_user@some_server.com/some_test_instance
        export ELIVE_TEST_PASS=some_password
        make test

    WARNING: These tests will both create and delete various entities
    instances. For this reason you should by wary of running the live
    tests on production sites.

    Consider restricting live testing to designated development and test
    sites, or newly created site instances!

POST INSTALLATION

    The elive_query script can be used to check basic operation of Elive
    and access to your Elluminate server(s).

        % elive_query --adapter=standardv2 --user sdk_user http://myserver/mysite
        Password: ******

    You can then try a simple query:

        elive> select * from serverVersions
