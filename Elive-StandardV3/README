Perl bindings for the Elluminate Live Standard Bridge V3 API.

** DEVELOPER RELEASE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION **

Elluminate Live! (c) is software for virtual online classrooms. It is
suitable for meetings, demonstrations web conferences, seminars and
general training and support.

Elive-StandardV3 is a set of Perl bindings and entity definitions for the
Elluminate Standard Bridge V3 SOAP services ('standardv2' adapter).

This is an alternative to the Command Toolkit, as supported by the
Elive::Entity classess ('default' adapter).

You will need to ensure that the Standard V3 bridge is enabled and that
the SDK user has been set up. Please see the Server Configuration section.

INSTALLATION
============
To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

SERVER CONFIGURATION
====================

Elluminate Live Manager
-----------------------
Please ensure that your the standard bridge (V3) is enabled. To do this,
login to http://your_server.com/elmcontrol with an appropriate administrator
account.

Edit/create the appropriate server instance and tick 'Elluminate Standard
Bridge V3 ...' in the 'Bridge Selection' section.

You will then be asked to enter the SDK username and password. 

LIVE TESTING

    There are additional live tests in t/soap-*.t. By default, these
    either skipped or run offline.

    These may be run against a live server by setting up the environment
    variables, an running tests, as shown below:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        export ELIVE_TEST_URL=http://sdk_user@myserver.com/some_instance
        export ELIVE_TEST_PASS=secret
        make test

    WARNING: These tests will both create and delete various entities
    instances. For this reason you should by wary of running the live
    tests on production sites.

    Consider restricting live testing to designated development and test
    sites, or newly created site instances!

POST INSTALLATION

    The elive_query script can be used to check basic operation of Elive
    and access to your Elluminate server(s).

        % elive_query --adapter=standardv3 http://sdk_user@myserver/mysite
        Password: ******

    You can then try a simple query:

        elive> select * from serverVersions   
                      
        versionId|versionMaxFilmersLimit|versionMaxTalkersLimit|versionName
        ---------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------
        1001     |6                     |6                     |10.0.1
