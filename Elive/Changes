Revision history for Elive

0.71    21st June 2010
        - Fixed elive_query (loading of Elive::Connection) from last
          change. Added a test for this.

0.70    21st June 2010
        Support for Elluminate 9.7 => 10.0
        - New Preload properties: isProtected and isDataAvailable.
        - New Recording properties: sessionInstanceId, startDate and endDate
        - Accommodated some newly introduced bugs/changes:

          -- User get_by_loginName() is no longer case insensitive

          -- Preloaded whiteboard files lost extension during insert/update
             (introduction.wdb => introduction).

             Note: attempted insert/update of files with no extension will
             crash the SOAP request with the error message:

                  'String index out of range: -1'

0.69    11th June 2010

        - Raised SOAP::Lite dependency 0.69 => 0.712. This eliminates some
          encoding failures under old perls (5.8.8-) and slightly older
          versions of SOAP::Lite. Encoding/decoding of HTML entities now
          properly handled. Thanks SOAP::Lite maintainers!

        - Minor refactorings refactorings to Elive codebase in order to pass
          Test::Perl::Critic severity level 4 tests (00c-critic.t).

          -- Most commonly, Atomic parsing of subroutine arguments. E.g.
             what was:

	        sub disconnect {
                    my $class = shift;
                    my %opt = @_;
                    # ...
                }

             After refactoring becomes:

                sub disconnect {
                    my ($class, %opt) = @_;
                    # ....
                }

	Second most common refactoring was adding explicit final 'return'
        to subroutines. For gory details, see svn commit of rev 377.

0.68    2nd June 2010
        - Added new entity class: Elive::Entity::Report.
        - Bug fix: Entity data was being returned with encoded
          entities. HTML::Entities::decode_entities is now used.

0.67    28th May 2010
        - Added Elive::Entity::Recording::upload() method.

0.66    22nd May 2010
        - Moved check of property checks from Elive::Entity to
          Elive::Struct. Made it a moose /mouse BUILDARGS method.
        - Added 'type' field to participants method. Newly discovered
          due to above BUILDARGS check.
        - Recordings do not have to be associated with a Meeting. Made
          RecordingId optional.
        - Allow objects where ids are expected. For example:

             Elive::Entity::Meeting->new({facilitatorId => $user,
                # ...
             });

           Instead of:

             Elive::Entity::Meeting->new({facilitatorId => $user->userId,
                # ...
             });

0.65    17th May 2010
        - Hide participants in elive_query script - not a retrievable entity.
        - pod tweaks.

0.64    11th March 2010
        - Elive::Entity::Group changed GroupId from Int to Str. Can be
          non-numeric when groups are configured for LDAP.

0.63    7th March 2010
        - Fixed usage/error messages in Elive::Entity '_readback' method.
        - RestrictedMeeting flag appears inoperative in Elm 9.7. Added a
	  test in 22-entity-meeting.t to catch this in 9.8 onwards.
        - Added -restricted option to elive_raise_meeting. Will require
          the above Elm fix to become effective.

0.62    16th February 2010
        Changes to README doco re troubleshooting and meeting pod.

0.61    26th January 2010
        elive_raise_meeting support for Elluminate 9.7 release
        - Modified user search/validation filter for Elm 3.2 compatibility.
        - Added 'quit' command. Also 'describe'; alias for 'show'.

0.60    25th January 2010
        - Added -occurs option to elive_raise_meeting script
        - Further tweaks to README

0.59    23rd January 2010
        - Updated README file to reflect Elluminate 9.5+ configuration.
        - Took out Elive->collections method. Easily derivable and only
          used in testing.

0.58    14th January 2010
        Support for Elluminate 9.7 release:
        - Added new field 'dn' to Elive::Entity::Group - LDAP domain name.
        - Added Elive::Entity::Group::_thaw(). This was required to handle
          modified output from Group DAO. We now get a single result with
          all members separated by ';', instead of a list of individual
          members.
        - Fix in Elive::Entity::_thaw(). It was modifying parts of the input
          struct. Now makes a copy on entry via Storable::dclone.
        - added 27-soap-group.t - group specific tests.

0.57    5th January 2010
        - Altered tests to pass Mouse 0.40 constraints, '+002' is not
          considered a valid 'Int'(?). Transient Mouse bug?
        - Elive::Entity - Added a warning for attempted use of is_changed on
          none database objects.

0.56    4th January 2010
        - Objects are now automatically stringified on all SOAP calls.
            For example:
             Elive::Entity::Meeting->insert({
                    facilitatorId => $user->userId,
	            # ...
	      });

            Can now be written:
             Elive::Entity::Meeting->insert({
                    facilitatorId => $user,
                    # ...
             });

        - Improved mock testing coverage. Now able to run much of
	  the meeting and recording tests offline.
        - Pod/doco improvements. In particular, show a meeting insert
          in the introductory example.
        - Removed some unreachable code from elive_raise_meeting.

0.55    21st December
        - Improved & corrected SOAP mock tests for 26-soap-user.t
        - Corrected handling of get_by_LoginName when user not found.
          fixed/added sanity checks on deleting login or admin users.

          fixed/added sanity checks on deleting login or admin users.

        This release introduces basic mock testing of elive Connections:
        - Added t::Elive::MockConnection and t::Elive::MockSOM:
        - The following tests can now run on mock or live connections:
          20-soap-connect.t, 21-soap-entities.t and 29-multi-connect.t
        - Added mock only user insert/update tests: 26-soap-user.t
        - Elive::Entity::User - Fixed password update bugs.

0.53    14th December
        Revised some tests failing test for mouse 0.43. Use strings for
        long numerics. E.g. '1256168907389', instead of 1256168907389.

0.52    1st December
        changed 'use UNIVERSAL' to 'require UNIVERSAL' to avoid calling
        UNIVERSAL::import method. Depreciated under perl 5.11.2+.

          e.g. $meeting->uppdate({name => 'abc '}).
        - Removed Elive::Entity::ParticipantList->insert() method for

            Elive::Entity::ParticipantList->insert($mtg,['12345=2',456778]);
