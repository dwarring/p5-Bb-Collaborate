Upload data from a client and create a recording.

=head2 insert

You'll typically only need to insert recordings yourself if you are importing
or recovering recordings that have not been closed cleanly.

    my $recordingId = "${meetingId}_import";
    my $import_filename = sprintf("%s_recordingData.bin", $recording->recordingId);

    #
    # Somehow import the file to the server. This needs to be uploaded
    # to ${instancesRoot}/${instanceName}/WEB-INF/resources/recordings
    # where $instanceRoot is typically /opt/ElluminateLive/manager/tomcat
    #
    import_recording($import_filename);

    my $recording = Elive::Entity::Recording->insert({
        recordingId => $recordingId,
        roomName => "test recording import",
        creationDate => time().'000',
        meetingId => $meetingId,
        facilitator => $meeting->faciliator,
        version => Elive->server_details->version,
        size => length($number_of_bytes),
   });


The Recording C<insert>, unlike other entities, method requires that you supply
a primary key. This is then used to determine the name of the file to look for
in the recording directory, as in the above example.

The meetingId is optional. Recordings do not have to be associated with a
particular meetings. They will still be searchable and are available for
playback.

=head2 web_url

Utility method to return various website links for the recording. This is
available as both class level and object level methods.

    #
    # Class level access.
    #
    my $url = Elive::Entity::Recording->web_url(
                     recording_id => $recording_id,
                     action => 'play',
                     connection => $my_connection);  # optional


    #
    # Object level.
    #
    my $recording = Elive::Entity::Recording->retrieve([$recording_id]);
    my $url = recording->web_url(action => 'join');

sub web_url {
    my ($self, %opt) = @_;

	unless $recording_id;

	or die "not connected";

    my $url = $connection->url;

	);

    die "unrecognised action: $action"
	unless exists $Actions{$action};

    return sprintf($Actions{$action},
		   $url, $recording_id);
}

=head2 buildJNLP 

    my $jnlp = $recording_entity->buildJNLP(version => version,
					    userId => $user->userId,
					    userIP => $ENV{REMOTE_ADDR});

Builds a JNLP for the recording.

JNLP is the 'Java Network Launch Protocol', also commonly known as Java
WebStart. You can, for example, render this as a web page with mime type
C<application/x-java-jnlp-file>.

The C<userIP> is required for elm 9.0+ when C<recordingJNLPIPCheck> has
been set to C<true> in C<configuration.xml> (or set interactively via:
Preferences E<gt>E<gt> Session Access E<gt>E<gt> Lock Recording Playback to Client IP)

It represents a fixed client IP address for launching the recording playback.
