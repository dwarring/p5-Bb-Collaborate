=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Elive;
    use Elive::Entity::User;

    Elive->connect('http://someEllumServer.com/test',
                   'serversupport', 'mypass');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Elive is a set of Perl modules for the integration and automation of
Elluminate Live sites. In particular, it aids in the management of users
and meetings.

It provides convenient Perl object bindings to entities. These are accessed
and updated via the Elluminate Live SOAP/XML command interface.

=head1 BACKGROUND

Elluminate Live (c) is is a web tool for virtual online classrooms.

It is suitable for online collaboration, demonstrations, meetings, web
conferences, seminars and IT deployment, training and support.

Users, Meetings and other resources are stored in a management database.
These can managed via the Elluminate Live web interface.

Most actions that can be performed via the web interface are also
available from Elluminate Live's SOAP/XML command interface.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 connect

     my $e1 = Elive->connect('http://myServer.com/test1', user1, pass1);

     Elive->connect('http://myServer.com/test2', user2, pass2);
     my $e2 = Elive->connection;

Connects to an Elluminate server instance. Dies if the connection could
not be established. For example the connection or user login failed.

The login user must be an Elluminate Live system administrator account.

See also Elive::Connection.

=cut

sub connect {

    my $class = shift;
    my ($url, $login_name, $pass) = @_;

    die "usage: ${class}->new(url, login_name[, pass])"
	unless ($class && $url && $login_name);

    my $connection = Elive::Connection->connect(
	$url,
	$login_name,
	$pass,
	debug => $class->debug,
	);

    $class->connection($connection);

    #
    # The login name should be a valid user in the database.
    # retrieve it as a way of authenticating the user and
    # checking basic connectivity.
    #
    $connection->login;

    return $connection;
}

=head1 ERROR MESSAGES

Elluminate Services Errors:

=over 4

=item   "Unable to determine a command for the key : listXxxx"

This may indicate that the particular command adaptor is is not available for
your site instance.

Check that your Elluminate server software is up-to-date (Elive has been tested
against Elluminate Live 9.0 and 9.1 only).

If the problem persists, the command entry may be missing from your site
configuration file. Please follow the instructions in the README file
for instructions on detecting and repairing missing adapters.

=head1 SCRIPTS

=head2 elive_query

elive_query is an example simple sql-like script. It is a basic program
for listing and retrieving entities. It serves as a simple demonstration
script, and can be used to confirm basic operation of Elive.

elive_query is simply passing where clauses, but through to the Elluminate
server as filters on SOAP calls.

For example, for the statement

    elive> select * from users where name like smith*

The equivalent Elive method call is:

    my $users = Elive::Entity::User->list(filter => 'name like smith*');

The exception is where clauses of the form C<pkey = val>, where C<pkey> is
the primary key for the entity table. e.g:

    elive> select * from meetingParticpants where meetingId = 1234567

The equivalent Elive method call for the above is

    my $participants =  Elive::Entity::MeetingParticpant->retrieve([1234567]);

Also be careful to avoid selecting large amounts of data, e.g. all users.

=head2 elive_raise_meeting

This is a demonstration script to create a meeting, set options, assign
participants and upload meeting preloads (whiteboard and media files to be
used to used for the meeting.

For more information, type the command: elive_raise_meeting --help

=head2 elive_lint_config

A utility script that checks your Elluminate server configuration. Please
see the README file.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item Elive is a new module

I have so far run it against a limited number of Elluminate 9.0 and 9.1
installations.

So far it does not implement all SOAP/XML calls, but concentrates on users,
meetings and meeting participants.

=item Database Access

Elluminate SOAP/XML interface doesn't provide for locking or transactional
control. The Elluminate server installs with the Mckoi pure Java database
which supports JDBC access.

The Elluminate Live advanced configuration guide mentions that it can be
configured to use other databases that support a JDBC bridge (most databases
in widespread use do). However, it specifically mentions SQL Server or Oracle. 

=item LDAP Authentication

Elluminate Live can also be configured to use an LDAP repository for
user authentication.  Users can still be retrieved or listed.

Note also, that if you don't define a LDAP mapping for the userId, the LDAP
DAO aliases the userId to loginName.

However updates and deletes are not supported by the LDAP DAO adapter. You
may also want to consider using another module such as Net::LDAP, to access
and maintain the repository.

=head1 SUPPORT

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-elive at rt.cpan.org>,
or through the web interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Elive>.
I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
your bug as I make changes.

You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.
