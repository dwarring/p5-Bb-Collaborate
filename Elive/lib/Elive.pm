=head1 DESCRIPTION

Elluminate Live (c) is is a synchronous web tool for virtual online classrooms.

It is suitable for online collaboration, demonstrations, meetings, web
conferences, seminars and IT deployment, training and support.

Users, Meetings and other resources are stored in a management database.
These can managed via the Elluminate Live web server. Most actions can also
be performed via a Elluminate Live's SOAP/XML SDK.

Elive implements Perl object bindings for the Elluminate Live SOAP/XML SDK.

It is designed to assist in then integration and automation of Elluminate
Live sites. In particular, managing users and meetings..

=head1 ERROR MESSAGES

Elluminate Services Errors:

=over 4

=item   "Unable to determine a command for the key : listXxxx"

This may indicate that the particular command adaptor is is not available for
your site instance.

Check that your Elluminate server software is up-to-date (Elive has been tested
against Elluminate Live 9.0 and 9.1 only).

If the problem persists, the command entry may be missing from your site
configuration file. Please follow the instructions in the README file
for insrtuctions on detecting and repairing missing adapters.

=head1 SCRIPTS

=head2 elive_query

elive_query is an example simple sql-like script. It is a basic program
for listing and retrieving entities. It serves as a simple demonstration
script, and can be used to confirm basic operation of Elive.

elive_query is simply passing where clauses, but through to the Elluminate
server as filters on SOAP calls.

For example, for the statement

    elive> select * from users where name like smith*

The equivalent Elive method call is:

    my $users = Elive::Entity::User->list(filter => 'name like smith*');

The exception is where clauses of the form C<pkey = val>, where C<pkey> is
the primary key for the entity table. e.g:

    elive> select * from meetingParticpants where meetingId = 1234567

The equivalent Elive method call for the above is

    my $participants =  Elive::Entity::MeetingParticpant->retrieve_all(1234567);

Also be careful to avoid selecting large amounts of data, e.g. all users.

=head2 elive_raise_meeting

This is a demonstration script to create a meeting, set options, assign
participants and upload meeting preloads (whiteboard and media files to be
used to used for the meeting.

For more information, type the command: elive_raise_meeting --help

=head2 elive_lint_config

A utility script that checks your Elluminate server configuration.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item Elive is a new module

I have so far run it against a limited number of Elluminate 9.0 and 9.1
installations.

So far it does not implement all SOAP/XML calls, but concentrates on users,
meetings and meeting participants.

-=item Database Access

Elluminate SOAP/XML interface doesn't provide for locking or transactional
control. The Elluminate server installs with the Mckoi pure Java database
which supports JDBC access.

The Elluminate Live advanced configuration guide mentions that it can be
configured to use other databases that support a JDBC bridge (most databases
in widespread use do). However, it specifcally mentions SQL Server or Oracle. 

=item LDAP Authentication

Elluminate Live can also be configured to use an LDAP respository for
user authentication.  Users can still be retrieved or listed. However
updates and deletes are not supported by the LDAP DAO adapter. See also
Net::LDAP.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-elive at rt.cpan.org>,
or through the web interface at L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Elive>.
I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
your bug as I make changes.
