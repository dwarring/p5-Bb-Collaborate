Elive is a set of Perl modules for access to Elluminate Live virtual
classroom server.

You can, for example, use it to query or add users, create sessions, assign
users as class participants and change server settings.

This package has been tested against Elluminate Live versions 9.0 thru 9.1.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

POST INSTALLATION

    elive_lint_config

       This script will check for missing adapters.

       It is recommended that you run this script on your configuration
       files for each Elluminate site instance.

       You'll probably want to copy the site configuration from the server
       and run this script on it there.

       For a Unix server the configration for path http://myserver/mysite/
       should be found under:

             /opt/ElluminateLive/manager/tomcat/webapps/mysite

          or if its running from the server root http://myserver/:

             /opt/ElluminateLive/manager/tomcat/webapps/ROOT

          The actual configuration is then in the sub-path:

	     WEB-INF/resources/configuration.xml

          If any adapters are missing, the corresponding Elive calls
          will return the error message 'Unable to determine a command
          for the key Xxxxx'.

          If you get this error, please check that your Elluminate Live
          software is up-to-date. Ii you've installed all upgrades and
          the SDK.

          Its possible that you may need to edit the configuration file
          manually to add the adapter.

          You'll need to stop Elluminate services before editing.

          For example, if elive_lint_conf returned the error:

	      "missing adapter command: getUser"

         Then this can be fixed by editing the config and adding an
         entry for the adapter, e.g.if getUser is missing:

	      <elm>
                  ...
                  <adapters>
                     <adapter>
                        ...
                        <argument>
                             <name>command:getUser</name>
                             <value>com.elluminate.adapter.command.GetUserCommand</value>
                         </argument>


    elive_query

        This is a simple shell that can be used to test basic access
        to your Elluminate Live server

        Usage is: elive_query --user SomeAdmin http://myserver/mysite

	Where SomeAdmin is an Elluminate system adminstrator account.

        Hopefully you should get:

	    connecting to http://myserver/mysite...done
            Elive query 0.nn - type 'help' for help
            elive>

        You can then try a simple query:

            elive> select * from users
