Elive is a set of Perl modules for scripting management and integration
of Elluminate Live! virtual classroom servers.

You can, for example, use it to query or add users, create sessions, assign
users as class participants and change server settings.

This package has been tested against Elluminate Live! versions 9.0 thru 9.1.

You will need to be able to login in to your SOAP service using an Elluminate
system administrator level account.

Note that Elluminate installs with 'serversupport' and 'legacyadapter' as
preset system adminstrator accounts. Don't forget to change passwords on
both these accounts before use!

INSTALLATION

    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

TESTING

    There are additional live tests in t/20-soap-*.t. These are skipped by
    default, but may be run by setting up some enviroment variables to
    reference an Elluminate Live! user and site instance.

    WARNING: These tests will both create and delete various entities
    on the site instances. For this reason you should avoid running
    tests on production sites.

    To run these additional tests:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        export ELIVE_TEST_URL=http://some_server.com/some_test_instance
        export ELIVE_TEST_USER=some_admin_user
        export ELIVE_TEST_PASS=some_password
        make test

    Again, please restrict your testing to designated development and
    test sites, or newly created site instances!

POST INSTALLATION

    elive_lint_config

        This script will check for missing adapters.

        It is recommended that you run this script on your Elluminate
        Live site configuration files.

        For a Unix server the configration for path http://myserver/mysite/
        should be found under:

             /opt/ElluminateLive/manager/tomcat/webapps

        or under Windows:

             C:/Program Files/ElluminateLive/manager/tomcat/webapps

        The actual configuration is then in the sub-path:

             ROOT/WEB-INF/resources/configuration.xml

         or for any additional sites built with the instance manager:

             mysite/WEB-INF/resources/configuration.xml

        If any adapters are missing, the corresponding Elive calls will
        return the error message 'Unable to determine a command for the key
        Xxxxx'.

        If you get this error, please check that your Elluminate Live
        software is up-to-date. This version Elive has only been tested
        against Elluminate Live! 9.0 and 9.1.

        You may be able to get away with manually adding the adapter to
        the list of adapters in your configuration file.

        For example, if elive_lint_config returned the error:

            "missing adapter command: getUser"

        You'll need to first stop Elluminate services.

        Save a backup copy of configuration.xml Then you can add an adapter
        entry can be added to the list of adapters.

        E.g., to add the getUser adapter:

            <elm>
                ...
                <adapters>
                   <adapter>
                      <commands>
                        ...
                        <command name="getUser" class="com.elluminate.adapter.command.GetUserCommand" />


    elive_query

        This is a simple shell that can be used to test basic access
        to your Elluminate Live server

        Usage is: elive_query --user SomeAdmin http://myserver/mysite

        Where SomeAdmin is an Elluminate system administrator account.

        You will need to enter a password. You should then get:

            connecting to http://myserver/mysite...done
            Elive query 0.nn (Elluminate Live 9.x.y) - type 'help' for help
            elive>

        You can then try a simple query:

            elive> select * from users
