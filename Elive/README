Elive is a set of Perl modules for management and integration of Elluminate
Live virtual classroom servers.

You can, for example, use it to query or add users, create sessions, assign
users as class participants and change server settings.

This package has been tested against Elluminate Live versions 9.0 thru 9.1.

You will need to login in to your SOAP service using an Elluminate system
administrator level account.

Note that Elluminate installs with 'serversupport' and 'legacyadapter' as
preset system adminstrator accounts. Don't forget to change password for
both these accounts before use!

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

POST INSTALLATION

    elive_lint_config

        This script will check for missing adapters.

        It is recommended that you run this script on your Elluminate
        Live site configuration files.

        For a Unix server the configration for path http://myserver/mysite/
        should be found under:

             /opt/ElluminateLive/manager/tomcat/webapps/mysite

        or if its running from the server root http://myserver/:

             /opt/ElluminateLive/manager/tomcat/webapps/ROOT

        The actual configuration is then in the sub-path:

	     WEB-INF/resources/configuration.xml

        If any adapters are missing, the corresponding Elive calls will
        return the error message 'Unable to determine a command for the key
        Xxxxx'.

          If you get this error, please check that your Elluminate Live
          software is up-to-date. I.e. you've installed all upgrades and
          the SDK. This version Elive has only been tested against 9.0
          and 9.1.

          It's possible that you may be able to manually add the adapter
          to your configuration.

          You'll need to first stop Elluminate services.

          For example, if elive_lint_conf returned the error:

	      "missing adapter command: getUser"

         Then an adapter entry can be added to the list of adapters.
         E.g. to add getUser:

	      <elm>
                  ...
                  <adapters>
                     <adapter>
                        ...
                        <argument>
                             <name>command:getUser</name>
                             <value>com.elluminate.adapter.command.GetUserCommand</value>
                         </argument>


    elive_query

        This is a simple shell that can be used to test basic access
        to your Elluminate Live server

        Usage is: elive_query --user SomeAdmin http://myserver/mysite

	Where SomeAdmin is an Elluminate system administrator account.

        You will need to enter a password. You should get:

	    connecting to http://myserver/mysite...done
            Elive query 0.nn (Elluminate Live 9.x.y) - type 'help' for help
            elive>

        You can then try a simple query:

            elive> select * from users
